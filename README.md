## About the Project

RockViewer lets you load OBJ/MTL 3D models and thin-section images, annotate points and zones, measure distances and areas, switch between light/dark themes, and capture screenshots. The 3D viewer provides orbit controls, orthographic views, ambient/directional lighting, dynamic scale bars and axes helpers. The 2D viewer supports pan/zoom, a circular magnifier, overlay annotations and HTML2Canvas screenshot export. Metadata from JSON files displays in a slide-out sidebar.

## Features

1. **3D Model Loading**

Import OBJ/MTL, center model automatically and adjust camera based on its bounding box.

2. **Linear Measurement**

Click once to place first marker, click again to draw a line and display distance in cm.

3. **Area Measurement**

Click successive points to form a polygon, compute and display area in cmÂ².                  

4. **3D Annotations**

Sphere and mesh annotations with pop-up content and connector lines that follow the camera.

5. **Dynamic Scale Bar**

2D overlay showing real-world scale that updates with camera FOV and distance.

6. **Screenshot Capture**

Export the current 3D or 2D view as a PNG file.

7. **2D Thin Section**

Pan/zoom SVG-backed image, circular magnifier, point and polygon annotations with pop-ups.

8. **Light/Dark Theme**

Toggle between themes; colors and shadows adapt via CSS variables and data-theme attribute.

9. **Metadata Sidebar**

Fetch and render sample metadata from JSON in a slide-out panel.

10. **Responsive & Fullscreen**

Adapts to window resize, toggle fullscreen mode for immersive viewing.
